\chapter{Front Matter}

The first thing is to connect the class by saying:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{uvamscse}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

\section{Title}

Specify the title of the thesis with \cmd{title} and \cmd{subtitle} commands:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\title{MetaThesis}
\subtitle{A Thesis Template Leading by Example}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

Any thesis can survive without a \cmd{subtitle}, but the \cmd{title} is mandatory.

\section{Author}

Introduce yourself with \cmd{author} and \cmd{authemail}:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Vadim Zaytsev}
\authemail{vadim@grammarware.net}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

Again, \cmd{authemail} is not mandatory. If you need anything fancier, just put it inside \cmd{author}.

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Vadim Zaytsev\footnote{Yes, that one.}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

The footnote would be printed on the bottom of the title page, and will be
referred to by a symbol, not by a number as any footnotes within the main
document body.

\section{Date}

By default, the date inserted in your PDF is the day of the build, e.g., ``March 25, 2014''. If you want it to be formatted differently or be more vague or outright fake, use \cmd{date}:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\date{Spring 2014}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

The argument is just a string, the format is unrestricted:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\date{Tomorrow. Honestly.}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

\section{Host}

If your hosting organisation is not the UvA, specify it with \cmd{host}. The
logo on the bottom of the title page will still be the UvA one, because this
is the organisation guaranteeing your degree.

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\host{Grammarware, Inc., \url{http://grammarware.github.io}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

NB: footnotes will not work, unless you know how to \cmd{protect} them.

\section{Cover picture}

If the first page of your thesis looks too blunt, add a picture to it:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\coverpic{figures/terminal.png}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

You can even specify the picture's width as an optional argument:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\coverpic[100pt]{figures/terminal.png}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

How these three options look, you can see from \autoref{fig:titles}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{figures/title1.pdf}}
  \hfill
  \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{figures/title2.pdf}}
  \hfill
  \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{figures/title3.pdf}}
  \caption{A hypothetical thesis title page without a cover picture (on the left), with an overly large one (in the centre) and with a tiny pic (on the right).}
  \label{fig:titles}
\end{figure}

\section{Abstract}

A thesis is fine without an abstract, if you do not feel like writing it and
your supervisor does not feel like enforcing it. If you do want an abstract,
make it with the \cmd{abstract} command:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\abstract{This is not a thesis.}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

The abstract is just like any other section of your thesis, so you can use any
\LaTeX\ tricks there. If you think that the name ``abstract'' is too abstract
for your abstract, you can still use \cmd{abstract} without being too
abstract:

\begin{snippet}
\begin{verbatim}
\abstract[Confession]{I am a cenosillicaphobiac.}
\end{verbatim}
\end{snippet}

Kent Beck~\cite{JohnsonBBCGW93} proposes to have four sentences in a good abstract:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first states the problem.
  \item The second states why the problem is a problem.
  \item The third is the startling sentence.
  \item The fourth states the implication of the startling sentence.
\end{enumerate}

In practice, each of these ``sentences'' can be longer than an actual
sentence, but it is in general a good rule of thumb to condense the summary of
your thesis into these four tiny messages. Do not write too much, make it
tweetable.
